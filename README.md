# Part and Product Management Application 

# Description 
This application is used for the management of parts and products in an inventory system. The project includes search functionality, table displays, and inherited classes. Parts can be marked as in-house or outsourced, which requires either a machine ID or a company name to be entered. Parts and products can be modified, added, and deleted. No database functionality is currently set up for the application but could easily be implemented using MySQL or something equivilant. 


# Future Implementations 
- Database functionality
- Login screen with user functionality
